Welcome to the Dix!

This project was created to help people create and measure diets progress. This project will be developed. So I will add new information when I will add new functionality.

On this moment I create forms to add new diets, exercises and login interface. On my project I use mysql database because it's easy and fast to use.

When we talk about tools on this project was used Struts and Hibernate framework to build web application with acces to database. To manage project I use maven because it's a stable tool and allows me to fast add a new package to my project.
